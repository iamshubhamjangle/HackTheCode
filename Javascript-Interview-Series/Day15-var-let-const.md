Understanding var, let, and const is crucial for managing variable scope and immutability in JavaScript. Use var for function-scoped variables, let for block-scoped variables, and const for block-scoped constants. The choice between them affects the behavior and maintainability of your code.

### Differences

Scope:

- var is function-scoped.
- let and const are block-scoped.

Hoisting:

- var variables are hoisted and initialized to undefined.
- let and const variables are hoisted but not initialized, causing a temporal dead zone.

Reassignment:

- var and let variables can be reassigned.
- const variables cannot be reassigned, but the contents of objects and arrays declared with const can be modified.

Redeclaring

- var can be redeclared
- let, const cannot be redeclared
